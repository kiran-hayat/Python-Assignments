# Python Assignments Repository

Welcome to my Python Assignments Repository! This repository contains assignments organized by topic, each folder corresponding to a different subject area.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of assignments given by my instructor, organized into folders based on different topics such as Python, Python Deep Dive, and Plotly. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) where assignments are solved and documented.

## Repository Structure

- **Python**: Assignments related to general Python programming.
- **Python Deep Dive**: Assignments focusing on advanced Python features and libraries.
- **Plotly**: Assignments using the Plotly library for interactive visualizations.

Each folder (`python/`, `python-deep-dive/`, `plotly/`) contains:
- Jupyter Notebooks  where assignments are solved.
- Any necessary data files or resources used for the assignments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
